# Project State: Restitch

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-03
**Current Phase:** 2 - Composition Engine (COMPLETE + GAP CLOSED)
**Current Plan:** 05 of 05 complete (gap closure)
**Status:** Phase 2 complete - all 11 composition requirements satisfied, validation timing fixed

## Project Reference

**Core Value:** Frontend teams can compose data from multiple backend services without writing, deploying, or maintaining BFF code.

**What We're Building:** REST API composition gateway (restitch-gateway) that eliminates hand-written BFF layers through declarative YAML configuration. Think Apollo Router for REST APIs.

**Current Focus:** Phase 2 COMPLETE. Full composition engine with YAML config, expression compilation, DAG execution, response merging, and HTTP handler integration. Ready for Phase 3 (Authentication).

## Current Position

**Phase:** 2 of 5 (Composition Engine) - COMPLETE + GAP CLOSED
**Plan:** 05 of 05 complete
**Status:** Phase 2 complete with validation timing fix
**Last activity:** 2026-02-03 - Completed 02-05-PLAN.md (Validation timing fix for circular dependencies and missing step references)

**Progress:**
```
[################                                  ] 34% (11/32)
Phase 2 gap closed - validation timing bugs fixed
```

**Next Actions:**
1. Begin Phase 3 planning (Authentication)
2. Run `/gsd:discuss-phase 3` to gather context
3. Run `/gsd:plan-phase 3` to create execution plans

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:** 4 min for 01-01 (3 tasks), 3 min for 01-02 (2 tasks), 3 min for 01-03 (2 tasks), 5 min for 02-01 (3 tasks), 3 min for 02-02 (2 tasks), 9 min for 02-03 (2 tasks), 4 min for 02-04 (3 tasks), 2 min for 02-05 (3 tasks, gap closure)

**Blockers:** None currently

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions

**2026-02-03 - Roadmap Creation**
- Decision: 5-phase structure following dependency chain (Gateway -> Composition -> Auth -> Resilience -> Observability)
- Rationale: Natural grouping by delivery boundaries, each phase delivers complete verifiable capability
- Impact: Foundation phase must establish HTTP patterns correctly (connection pooling, context propagation) as all later phases depend on this

**2026-02-03 - Phase 1 Must Avoid Critical Pitfalls**
- Decision: Phase 1 includes proper connection pooling, context propagation, and goroutine cleanup from start
- Rationale: Research identified these as common production issues; fixing later requires refactoring all phases
- Impact: Phase 1 includes patterns that seem like optimization but are actually correctness requirements

**2026-02-03 - Plan 01-01 Execution**
- Decision: Stdlib only for HTTP/TLS (no external dependencies)
- Decision: Router supports exact and prefix path matching
- Decision: TLS 1.2+ minimum with modern cipher preferences (P-256, X25519)
- Decision: HTTP and HTTPS servers run concurrently in goroutines
- Rationale: Clean foundation using Go's excellent stdlib, modern security defaults

**2026-02-03 - Plan 01-02 Execution**
- Decision: Health endpoint returns verbose JSON (status, uptime, version, memory)
- Decision: Ready endpoint checks gateway state only (upstream checking deferred)
- Decision: JSON logging by default, text format via --log-format=text flag
- Decision: Middleware pattern with ResponseWriter wrapper to capture status code
- Rationale: Standard Kubernetes probe patterns, 12-factor logging to stdout

**2026-02-03 - Plan 01-03 Execution**
- Decision: WaitForShutdownSignal returns channel for select-based coordination
- Decision: SetReady(false) called immediately on signal for instant /ready 503
- Decision: MaxIdleConnsPerHost: 100 to avoid 4-5x latency penalty from default 2
- Decision: DrainAndClose helper ensures proper connection pool return
- Rationale: Signal handling via channel + select allows coordination with error channel; HTTP client configured per research findings

**2026-02-03 - Plan 02-01 Execution**
- Decision: All expressions compile at parse time (fail fast on syntax errors)
- Decision: Template-style {{ expr }} delimiters per CONTEXT.md
- Decision: BuildBaseEnvironment for consistent compile/runtime environments
- Decision: CompiledConfig separates parsing from compilation
- Rationale: Catch expression errors at startup (not request time); avoid expr-lang Pitfall 3 (function registration)

**2026-02-03 - Plan 02-02 Execution**
- Decision: Kahn's algorithm for topological sort with level detection
- Decision: AST visitor pattern for dependency extraction from expressions
- Decision: Automatic dependency inference from steps.X references
- Decision: Circular dependency detection at config parse time (not request time)
- Rationale: Standard DAG algorithm with O(V+E) complexity; AST visitor handles all expr syntax correctly; fail fast on cycles

**2026-02-03 - Plan 02-03 Execution**
- Decision: Upstream HTTP errors (500, 404) are passthrough - not step failures per CONTEXT.md
- Decision: Network/context errors trigger fail-fast via errgroup cancellation
- Decision: Header propagation uses case-insensitive lookup (HTTP headers canonicalized)
- Decision: Template interpolation checked BEFORE Program check (templates have Program==nil)
- Rationale: Upstream errors are results (Phase 2 completes all steps); network failures are true errors; HTTP header standard behavior; correct template detection order

**2026-02-03 - Plan 02-04 Execution**
- Decision: CompiledResponse stores original body template for runtime evaluation
- Decision: Single expressions return typed values, templates return interpolated strings
- Decision: Config file optional - gateway starts with health endpoints if missing
- Decision: Added HTTPClient() method to client.Client for interface compatibility
- Rationale: Template evaluation requires original structure; type preservation for complex objects; graceful degradation without config; standard http.Client interface needed by composition handler

**2026-02-03 - Plan 02-05 Execution (Gap Closure)**
- Decision: Move BuildDAG from request-time to parse-time for fail-fast validation
- Decision: Store ExecutionPlan in CompiledComposition to avoid redundant DAG builds
- Decision: Invalid configs prevent gateway startup with clear error messages
- Rationale: UAT tests 9 and 10 revealed validation timing bug - circular dependencies and missing step references were detected at request time instead of startup; moving BuildDAG to compileComposition() fixed both issues per CONTEXT.md fail-fast principle

### Research Flags

**Phase 1:** SKIP research (standard Go patterns, well-documented) - COMPLETE
**Phase 2:** SKIP research (Expr and YAML libraries have excellent docs)
**Phase 3:** MAY NEED research for OAuth2 edge cases (concurrent token refresh, cache invalidation)
**Phase 4:** MAY NEED research for partial response UX (200 vs 207 Multi-Status decision)
**Phase 5:** SKIP research (standard observability patterns)

## Session Continuity

### What Just Happened

Phase 2 COMPLETE with gap closure - All 11 composition requirements satisfied, validation timing bugs fixed:

Plan 02-05 deliverables (Gap Closure):
- DAG validation moved from request-time to parse-time (internal/composition/parser.go)
- ExecutionPlan pre-built and stored in CompiledComposition (eliminates redundant DAG builds)
- Gateway fails to start on circular dependencies with clear error message
- Gateway fails to start on missing step references with clear error message
- Tests verify startup-time validation (internal/composition/parser_test.go)

Commits:
- c6f311b: Move BuildDAG from request-time to parse-time
- 3f18df0: Add tests for startup validation failures

UAT Issues Resolved:
- Test 9 (Circular dependency detected at startup): FIXED - BuildDAG now called during CompileConfig()
- Test 10 (Missing step reference detected at startup): FIXED - validateDependencies runs at parse-time

Phase 2 requirements satisfied:
- COMP-01 through COMP-11: All ✓ (previously completed)
- UAT tests 9 and 10: ✓ (fixed in 02-05)

### What's Next

Phase 3: Authentication
- Gather context via `/gsd:discuss-phase 3`
- Create execution plans via `/gsd:plan-phase 3`
- Implement auth requirements (AUTH-01 through AUTH-06)
